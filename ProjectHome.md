# Spotify based office jukebox #

Requires a premium Spotify account.

### What is it? ###

Spoffice is a web-based service-side .NET music player developed predominately for office environments.

It is designed to take the difficulties out of playing music that most people like. If you are in an environment where one person controls the music and you dislike some/most of the music that they choose, then Spoffice is for you! Users can also easily change the theme of Spoffice to suit their mood.

### Todo: ###
  * ~~Create the basic ASP MVC app~~
  * ~~Allow browing of music using the spotify metadata api~~
  * ~~Adding songs to favourites~~
  * ~~Get the connection to spotify working~~
  * ~~Get it playing music~~
  * ~~Link it all up into something that'll play music~~
  * ~~Rewrite/refactor the music service and create data repositories~~
  * ~~Have XML/Json views for every single page~~ (mostly!)
  * ~~Make the interface ajax/js! and fully skin-able with jquery ui~~
  * ~~I18n support~~ (partially implemented, machine translated only currently, get in touch if you can provide translations)
  * ~~Get instant language changing working~~
  * Get the ratings system to make a difference to the song selection
  * ~~Implement the votes/skip feature~~
  * Better error handling throughout.
  * Flash front-end with stuff like coverflow. yum yum.
  * Simple air application
  * ~~Create other music players that can plug in (wmp.etc.)~~

### Status: ###

Currently plays music. Scrapping the non-javascript version for now and concentrating on a fully javascript/ajax frontend. A lot still to do! Watch this space.
